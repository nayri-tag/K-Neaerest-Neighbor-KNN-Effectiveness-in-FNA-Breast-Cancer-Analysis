# K-Neaerest-Neighbor-KNN-Effectiveness-in-FNA-Breast-Cancer-Analysis

Developed a Python project for data analysis and classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, removing multicollinear features and handling missing values effectively.

Implemented a custom KNN classifier from scratch, achieving comparable results to the off-the-shelf implementation on a new dataset.
